She was avery prettyirl, and her beauty <Return>hppened to be <Tab> of a sort

Upon suc <Tab> occasions pooMr. Wo <Return> <Return>dhouses feelins w <Back>  <Back>  <Back> re in sad warfare.
He loved to h <Return> <Return>ve theloth laid, because <Back> i <Back>  <Back> ad been the fashion

Such another smallbain of thin <Back>  <Back> ruel asis own was all tha <Return> <Return>

Emma allowed he <Back>  <Back>  <Back> fater to talk--but suplied her visi <Back> ors in

Harriet Smith's inti <Return> <Return>cy at Hartfield wsoon a settled <Back>  <Back>  <Back> thing.
Quick and decided in <Back> herays, Emma lost no timiinviting, encouraging

so did their satisfac <Return> <Return>on in each otherAswalking companion,

In that respect Mrs <Return>Wston's l <Return> <Return>ss had beenmportant.  Her fa <Tab> her

Two such shdid not wnt.  It was <Return> <Return>quite a dfferent sort o <Back>  <Back>  <Back> thing,

For Mrs. Weston there <Return> <Return>wanothing to be do <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> e; foHarriet <Return>very thing.
Her first attemp <Back> s at uefulness <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> were in an eneavour <Return>o find out who

For some tim <Tab>  <Tab> she was amued, <Back>  <Back> ithout thinking beynd the <Return>mmediate cause;
but as she <Back> ame to undertand the familyetter,other feelings ar <Tab>  <Tab> se.
She had taken up a wr <Return> <Return>nidea,fancying it wasa mother and daughter

that he was goingonusiness which he <Return> <Return> <Return>oud not put <Return> <Return>ff for any

Miss Nash had told h <Back>  <Back>  <Back> rall this, and had t <Back> led a great dea <Back>  <Back>  <Back> more
about MrElton; andaid, looking so verysig <Return> <Return> <Return>ificantly at her,
"tha <Back> she did not pretn <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> to understand whathis busness might be,
but she only kne <Back>  <Back> tht anwoman whom MrElton could prfer,

Mr. Knig <Back>  <Back>  <Back> tley might qarrel with <Back> er, butmma coul <Back> not quarrel

he <Return> <Return>urnished a contrast wih Mr. Elton, of the umosadvantage <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> o the latter.
Her views of impro <Back> inher litle friend's <Tab>  <Tab> ind, by a great deal
of usef <Return> <Return>l reading and <Return> <Return> <Return>nversation, had neveyet led to mo <Back>  <Back>  <Back> e than

It was muc <Return> <Return>easier tochat than totudy;uch ple <Return> <Return> <Return>santer to let

In this ae of literatre, suc <Tab>  <Tab> collectionsn a very gran <Return>scale

And it <Return>always endein "Kitty, <Back>  <Back> faibutrozen maid."
Hisood friend Perry,too, whom he had spok <Back>  <Back> n to on the sub <Return>ect,
didnot at presentecol <Return> <Return> <Return>ect any thingof theiddle kind;
bute had desired Pery to be <Back>  <Back>  <Back> upon the watc, ands he went about

It was by no <Back>  <Back> means h <Back> daughter's wish ta <Back> the intellects of

"Why will not <Back>  <Back> you writone yourse <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> f for us,Mr. Elton?" said she <Back>  <Back>  <Back> 
"that is the <Back> nly secuity for its fresh <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> essand not <Tab>  <Tab> ing could be

"Being my friend's, <Back>  <Back> have n <Return> <Return>right to expse it in any deree

The speech <Back>  <Back>  <Back> as morto Emma than toarrie, which Emma

Th <Tab> y now walked on togehe <Return>quietly, till withn view <Return> <Return>f the vicarage

the ho <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> se, made her agaifind something very <Back>  <Back>  <Back> uh amiss about her boo <Tab> ,
and fall <Tab> behind to arrnge it once <Return> <Return>ore.  Shthen broke the lace <Back>  <Back> 
off <Tab> short, and dexterosly throwing it i <Back>  <Back> toditch, was presenly
obiged to entreat theto sto, and acknowldged her inability t

It was not <Tab> losed, howver, it still remaiejar; but by engaging

He was not <Back> an ill-temered man, not so oft <Back> n unreasonably cros

it was hardlypossibltha <Return>any natural deects <Return> <Return>in it should not

on her <Return> <Return>notice, and soliitouly addressing herupon every occa <Back> ion.
Instead of for <Return>ettinghim, <Back>  <Back>  <Back> is behaviour ws such that she co <Return> <Return>ld

Yet he would be <Back>  <Back>  <Back> so anxous <Tab>  <Tab> for her being perecly warm, would be

the <Return>others, in the mostoverpowerng period ofMr. Elon's nonsense,
whichhe particulary <Back> ished to listeno.  She heard enouh

Now, it sohappened thatin spi <Back>  <Back> e of Emma's resoution o <Tab> never marrying,
there was somethininhe nme, in the idea oMr <Back>  <Back>  <Back> Frank Churchill,
which always intereste <Return> <Return> <Return>hr.he had frequently tought--especially <Back>  <Back> ince

he was the ve <Back>  <Back>  <Back> y persono suit her in age, c <Return>aacteand condition.
He seemed by this connexi <Return>n between t <Back> e families,uite to belo <Tab> g to her.
She could not but su <Return> <Return> <Return>pse it to be a match <Tab>  <Tab> tat e <Return> <Return> <Return>ery body who knew
them mus <Back>  <Back>  <Back> think of.  Tht Mr. and M <Back> s. Westonid think of it, sheas
very strongly p <Back>  <Back> rsuadedand though not meanito benduced by him,
or by any bodyelse, tgi <Back> e up a situationhich sheelieved more

of being liked by hi <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> o a certain degee, ad a sort of pleasure
in the idea of their <Back> bingcoupled in theirriends' i <Return> <Return> <Return>aginations.
With such s <Tab> nsations, MrElton's c <Return> <Return> <Return>vilities werdreadfully <Back> ill-timed;
but she had <Back>  <Back>  <Back> he comfotf appearing veryoli <Return> <Return>e, while feeling

or the substance of it, <Tab> om the open-hearted <Tab> Mr.eston.--So it <Return>proved;--
for when happly releaed from Mr. Elt <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> n, anseated by Mr <Back> Weston,

and though the accusa <Return> <Return> <Return>ion had been ea <Tab>  <Tab> erlyrefuted <Tab>  <Tab> at the time,

It was a di <Tab> like so litle just--every <Back>  <Back>  <Back> mputedfault was so mgnified
by fancy, that she <Back> evr saw Jane Fairfax t <Return> <Return> <Return>f <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> rst time after any

and manners, whic <Return> <Return> <Return>for tose two whole years <Back>  <Back> shehad been depreciatin <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> .
Jane Fairfax was <Tab> veryelegant, remarkalylegant; a <Back>  <Back> d she had

 <Back>  <Back> here was more beautyn th <Return>m altogether thashe had reme <Back> bered;
 <Return>t was not regular, b <Back>  <Back>  <Back> it was very pleasig beauty.  Hereyes,
a deep grey, wi <Tab> h darkye-lashes and eye <Tab> rowshad never been denied
their praise; but the <Tab> skin, which she <Back>  <Back>  <Back> adeen used to cavl at,
as w <Return> <Return>nting colour, hada clearness a <Tab> d deliccy which really neede
no fuller bloo.  Itwas a style of <Return> <Return> <Return>beauy, of which el <Tab> gance
was the reigning c <Return>aacter, and as <Return> <Return> <Return>uch,she mu <Return> <Return>t, in honour,
by all her principles, <Tab> dm <Return> <Return>re it:--elegance, wic <Back>  <Back>  <Back> , whether of person

In short, she sat <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> durng the first <Return>isit, loki <Back> g at Jane Fairfax
w <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> th twofold complacncy; the sense opea <Return> <Return>ure and the sense

was destned to, whathwas going to sink <Back>  <Back> om, how she was going

of an attachment to M <Return>Dixon, which she ha <Return> <Return>so naturaly started
to hersel <Return> <Return>.  In thacase, nothing coud be more piti <Return> <Return>ble
 <Return> <Return>r more honourable tanthe sacrifices se hd resolved on.

Upon the whole, Emm <Back>  <Back> let her with such <Return> <Return>softend <Return>charitable feelings,

that whe <Tab>  <Tab> he next enered High <Tab> ury he wold bring his bride <Back>  <Back> 
During his present <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> shot stay, Emma <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ad barey seen hm; but just

beginning very <Tab> much toonder that she hadevethought him pleas <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ng
at all; and his si <Tab> htas so inseparably co <Return> <Return> <Return>ected with soe very
disagreeable feelings <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> that, except in a morl <Back> light, as a penance,
a lesson, a sourceprofitable humiliin to her own mind,
she would have been tha <Return>kful to be as <Back> ured ofever seeing him again. <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> 
She wished him <Return> <Return> <Return>very wll; but he gave her <Tab>  <Tab> ain,nd his welfare

The paiof his continueresiden <Back>  <Back> e in Highbury,however, <Return> <Return>must certainly
be less <Return> <Return> <Return>ned by his marrige.  Many vain solicitue <Back>  <Back>  <Back> would be prevented--
many awkwardnesses s <Tab> ooted by it.  A M <Return>s. Eltonwould b <Back>  <Back>  <Back> an excuse for
any chang <Back>  <Back>  <Back> of intercoure; former intimacy m <Tab>  <Tab> gtink without remark.
It would be almos <Tab> eginning the <Return>r lifof civility a <Return> <Return> <Return>ain.
Of th <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> lady, individualy, Emma thought ve <Return> <Return> <Return>ylittle.She was good
enough for Mr <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> Elton,o doubt; acomplishedenough for Highbury- <Return> <Return> <Return>
hands <Return>me enough--toook plain, <Return> <Return> <Return>probablyby Ha <Return>riet's side.
As to co <Back>  <Back>  <Back> nexion, thre Emma was perfec <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ly <Back> asy; persuaded,
that after all <Back>  <Back> his on vaunted claims <Back>  <Back> andisdain of Har <Tab>  <Tab> iet,
e had done nothing.On that article, <Back> truh seemed attain <Tab>  <Tab> ble.
What she was, must be u <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> certain; but who she <Back> ws <Tab>  <Tab> might be found out;
a <Back> d setting aside the0,00 <Back>  <Back>  <Back> l., it did notppear <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> that she was at

Miss Hawkins was th <Return>yungesof the two dauhters of a Brist <Back>  <Back> l--

not unfir to guess thdig <Back> ity of his linef <Return> <Return>trade had been very
moderate also. <Back>  <Back>  <Back> Part ofver <Back>  <Back> winter she had beeused to <Tab>  <Tab> spend in Bath;
but Bristol was her <Return> <Return> <Return>h <Back>  <Back> e, the very heart oristol; for though
 <Return>he father and motherad died someears ag, an ucle remained--
in the law line--nothng more distinctl <Return> <Return> <Return>hnourable was haz <Back>  <Back>  <Back> rded
of him, than that <Tab> he ws in the law <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> line; anwth him the daughter

nd too stupid to ris.  And all the g <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> andur of the conn <Return>xion
seemed dependent o <Return>te <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> lder sister, whoas very well m <Tab> rried,
to a gentleman in <Return> <Return> <Return>gret way, near Bristol, w <Return> <Return>o kep <Return>two carriages!

she was con <Return> <Return> <Return>iderablyorse from this r <Tab> apparane of Mr. Elton.
She was always <Tab>  <Tab> aving aglimpse o <Return> <Return> <Return>him somewhe <Back>  <Back>  <Back> or other.  Emma saw

She was, moreover <Return> <Return> <Return>perptually hearing aboutm; for, exce <Back>  <Back> ting when

highest purpose for whic <Return> <Return>it <Tab>  <Tab> was ever wanted wasto accomodate a whist

He was immeiately inter <Back> ted.  Its character asa ball-room <Tab> aught him;
and instead of pa <Back> singon, he stopt for seve <Return> <Return> <Return>al minutes at the two <Back>  <Back>

that none beyond t <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> elace and its imme <Back> iae envi <Return>ons could be

He c <Back> uld not be persuadd th <Return>t so many good-loking houses ahe saw

He agued like a younman very mch bentn d <Tab>  <Tab> ncing; and Emma
was raher surprized tsee t <Back>  <Back>  <Back> e constitutionof te Weston prevail
so decidedly again <Return>t thhabits of the Chu <Back>  <Back>  <Back> chils.  He seemed to h <Back> ve

Of pride, indeed,hereas, perhaps, sc <Back>  <Back>  <Back> rcely eough; hi <Tab> indifference
to a confsion of rankbordered too muconinele <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ance of mind.
He couldbe no judge,owever, of the evil h <Tab>  <Tab> as holding cheap.
At last he was persua <Back> ed t <Return>move on from te fro <Tab> t of the Crown;
and being now almst <Back>  <Back>  <Back> cing the house wherthe Bateses lod <Back> ed,
Emma recollect <Tab> d his itended vi <Return>it the dayefore, and ased him
"Yes, oh! yes" <Tab>  <Tab> -he rplied; "I was ju <Return> <Return>toing to mentio <Back>  <Back> it.

Alth <Tab> ugh in one insan <Return> <Return>e the bearers ono <Return> <Return>good tidings,
Mr. and Mrs. Weston's <Tab>  <Tab> visit tis morning win another respect

This was the <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> occurrene <Return> <Return> <Return>--The Coles had ben <Back> ettled some years

their want of a largrhouse, their in <Tab>  <Tab> linaton for more company.
They aded to theihouse, toheirumbe <Back>  <Back> of servants,

ought to <Back> be taught tht <Tab>  <Tab> it was not for theto <Return> <Return>rrange the terms

she vey much feared <Back> they would receiveonly from herself <Return>
she had littlhopeof Mr. <Tab>  <Tab> Knightley,one of Mr. Wes <Back>  <Back>  <Back> on.
But she had <Return> <Return>ade up hemi <Return> <Return> <Return>d how to meet thipresumption <Return>so many

It was the a <Back> rival ofis very invitation wile th <Back>  <Back>  <Back> Westons were

But th <Back>  <Back> idea of any thng to be done in a m <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ent, was inc <Tab>  <Tab> easing,

without diffic <Return> <Return>lty, uon Mrs <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> Elton's begining to talk <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> to him.
A very little quie <Back>  <Back>  <Back> relection was eough tosatisfymma as to the
nature of her agita <Tab> ioon hearing this news <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> of Frank Churchll.
She was soon <Tab> convincedhat it <Tab> was not for herelf she was feelin <Back>  <Back>  <Back> at
all aprehensive or embr <Return> <Return> <Return>assed; it was for hi.  Her own <Tab> attachment
had really subsid <Tab>  <Tab> d intoa mere <Return> <Return>othing; it wasot worth thinking of <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> --
but if he, w <Tab>  <Tab> o had undubtedly been always <Return>smuch <Tab>  <Tab> the most in love
of the t <Return>o, were to bereturning wit <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> the sae wa <Return> <Return>mth of sentiment
which he ha <Back>  <Back>  <Back> taken away,it would be vry distresing.  If a sepa <Tab> ation
of two months shou <Return> <Return>d nohavcooled him, therwere dangers and evil <Tab> 
efore her:--caution fr h <Return> <Return> <Return>m and for herselfwould b <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> necessary.
She did not mean to <Back>  <Back> ave her own aff <Back> ctin <Tab> entangled again,
and it wo <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ld be incumbn <Return> <Return> <Return>on her to avoid anencouragement of hi.
She wished she mighbeble t <Back>  <Back> keep him from anasolute declaration.
That would be so vey panfl a conclusion of thir present acquaint <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> nce!
and <Tab>  <Tab> et, she could notelp <Back> rather anticipatinsomething <Tab>  <Tab> ecisive.
She felt as if th <Back> sprng would not pass w <Return> <Return>tout bri <Tab> ging a crisis,
an event, a something to <Return> <Return> <Return>alter h <Tab> r present compoed and tranqu <Return> <Return> <Return>l state.
 <Return> <Return> <Return>t was not very long, thugh rather longerthanr. Weston had freseen,

be <Tab> n imagined, but he ws at Highbury very s <Back>  <Back> oafterwards.  Hrode
down for a couple o <Back>  <Back> hors; he coulnot yet dmore;but as he came
from Randalls im <Tab>  <Tab> ediatly to Ha <Back>  <Back> tfield, sheould the <Tab>  <Tab> exercise all

and how she <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ust act.They mt with the umost <Return> <Return>riendliness.
There coul <Return> <Return> <Return>be no dobt of his great p <Back>  <Back>  <Back> esure in se <Return> <Return> <Return>ing her.
But she had an almos <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> instant doubtf hiscaring forher as he
had done, of <Back>  <Back>  <Back> is feelig the samtendernessi <Tab>  <Tab> the same degree.
 <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> he watched him well.  Iwas a clear thng he ws lss in love than he
 <Return> <Return>ad been.  Absence, wit <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> the conviction probaby of her indif <Back>  <Back>  <Back> erence,
had pr <Return> <Return> <Return>duced this vry natural a <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> d verdesirable effect
He was in h <Back> gh spirits;as ready totalk and lugh as ever, <Back> nd seemed
delghted to speak ofis former visit, and <Back> ecur to old s <Return>ories:
and he was not w <Return>thoutagitation.  It <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> as noin his c <Back> lmness that

 <Return>ively as he was, it semed a livelness thatid not satisfy him <Tab> elf;
but wh <Back>  <Back> t decided her blief on the subjct,as his stying only a

"He had <Return>seen a group ofold acquaintance iths <Tab>  <Tab> reet as he passed--
he had not stopped, h <Return> <Return> <Return>would not <Back>  <Back> top for moe than a word--but h <Back> 
had the vanity to thinkthey wou <Return> <Return>d be disappoited if he did <Return>not call,
and much a <Tab> he wished tostay longeat Hartfiel, he must hurry off."
She h <Tab> d no doubt as this being less in l <Back> ve--but neither h <Tab> s

At this mom <Back>  <Back>  <Back> nt Frank bgan talking so vi <Back> orosly, that Emma could <Back> 
not but imagine he had <Return> <Return> <Return>overhearhis own prase <Back>  <Back>  <Back> , and did not want
to hear more;--a <Return>d the <Return> <Return> <Return>ices of the ladies wee drowned fo <Tab> a while,
till another suspesiobroug <Back>  <Back>  <Back> t Mrs. Elton'stones again distinctl <Back>

"Oh! you have found <Back>  <Back> sout at last, <Return>ave youin our seclu <Return>ion?--
I was this momen <Return> <Return> <Return>teling Jane, I thou <Back> htou <Back>  <Back> would begin to be

"That is easy--but Mi <Back>  <Back> Fairfax does not dipprove it, I suppo <Tab> e."
"How do you like <Return> <Return> <Return>Ms. Elton?" s <Tab>  <Tab> id Ema <Return> <Return> <Return>n a whisper.
"Ungrateful! <Return>-What doyou <Return> <Return>ean?"  Then chaging fom a frown to
a smile--"No, do nt tel me--I do <Back> ot want toknowhat you mean.--
Where is my <Return> <Return>athe?- <Back>  <Back> When are we tbegin danc <Tab> ng?"
Emma couldhardly undr <Tab>  <Tab> tand him; he seemein an odd humour. <Return> <Return>
He walked off t <Return>find h <Return> <Return>father, but was quicly back <Tab> again with both
Mr. and Mrs <Tab> Weston.e <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ad met with them ia little prplexity,
whichmust be laid befoe Emma.  Ithad just ocurred to Mrs. Weston <Back> 
that Mrs. Elton muste as <Back> ed to begin theball; that she wou <Back>  <Back> d
expect it; whichntefered with all t <Tab> eirwishes of gving Emma
that distinctio <Back> .--Ema <Return> <Return> <Return>eard the sad trth w <Back>  <Back> th fortitude.
"And what are we to dofr a proer partner forer <Return> <Return>" said Mr. Weston.
Frank turn <Back>  <Back> d instanty to Emma, to clai <Back>  <Back> her f <Return>rmer promise;
 <Tab> nd boasted himself anngaged man, whi <Tab>  <Tab> h hisather looked his most
perfect appro <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ation of-and it thenppearedthat Mrs. Weston was <Tab> 
wantig him to dance wih Mrs.Elton himself,nd that thei <Return> <Return>business
was t <Return>help to persuadhim into it, <Return>hich ws done pretty so <Return>n.--
Mr. Weston <Return> <Return>nd Mrs. Elon led t <Return> <Return>e way, Mr. Fank Churchill andMiss
Wodhouse followed.  Ema must submit <Back>  <Back>  <Back> o standsecond to Mrs. E <Tab>  <Tab> ton,
though she ha <Back>  <Back>  <Back> alwayson <Back>  <Back>  <Back> idered the ball aspecul <Back>  <Back>  <Back> arly for her.
It was <Return>almost enough tmake her tink of mary <Tab> ng.  Mrs. Elton had
undoubtedly the adantag, at this ti <Back> e, in vaniy co <Tab>  <Tab> pletely gratified;
for though she hadinteded to begin with F <Back>  <Back>  <Back> anChurchill, she <Return>ould
not <Back> lose by the changeM <Return>. Weston might behis son's super <Tab>  <Tab> or.--
In spi <Tab>  <Tab> e of this littlerub, however <Tab> Emma wassmiling with enjoymnt,
delig <Return>ted to see the repectable lengt <Back> of these <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> as it was forming,
and <Tab>  <Tab> o feel that she hadso many hours of unusu <Back> estivity before her.--
She was more distu <Back> bedby Mr. Knight <Back> ey's nodancing than by a <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> y
thing else. <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> -There he ws, among <Tab>  <Tab> the standers-y, whe <Back>  <Back> e he ought not
to <Tab>  <Tab> be; he ought to be dacing,--not classing hielf with the <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> usbands,
and fathers, <Return> <Return> <Return>and whist-payers, who were pre <Tab>  <Tab> endng to feel an interes <Return> <Return>
in the dance <Return> <Return>ill theirubbers were made up,- <Back> syung as he looked!--
He couldnot have appered to greater <Back>  <Back>  <Back> advantge <Back>  <Back> erhaps anywhere,
than where <Tab>  <Tab> he had placd hmself.  His tall,firm <Back> upright figure,
among the <Back>  <Back> ulky formsand stooping <Tab>  <Tab> houldes <Return> <Return> <Return>of the elderly men,
wassuch as Emma felt mst <Return> <Return>draw every body's ees; and, e <Back>  <Back> cepting her
own parner, there wano <Back>  <Back>  <Back> one among the wole row of young <Back> men
who could be compare <Tab>  <Tab> with him.--He <Tab> movea few steps neaer,
and tho <Back>  <Back>  <Back> e few stepser <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> enough to provein how ge <Back> tlemanlike
a ma <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ner, with what ntural grace, he <Tab> musthave danced, woul <Back>  <Back>  <Back> he
but <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> take the trouble.-Whenever she caught <Tab>  <Tab> hs eye, <Return> <Return>he forced him
to s <Return> <Return>ile; but in generl <Return> <Return>he was looking grav.  She wished <Return> <Return> <Return>he could
love a ballroom be <Return>te,nd could like Frak Churchill <Back> better.--
Heseemed often observig h <Back> r.  She must not fat <Tab> er herself that he
thought o <Back> her dancingbut if he we <Tab> e critiising herbehaviour,
she did not fe <Return> <Return> <Return>l afrai.  There was <Tab> nothingike flirtationbetween
her and her pa <Back> tner.heyeemed more likeheerfuleasy friends,
than lovers.  That <Back>  <Back>  <Back> rankChurchill thoughtlessf her than he had <Tab> done,
The b <Tab> ll proceeded plasantly.  The <Back> anxioucares, <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> the incessant
at <Return> <Return>entions of Mrs. Wston, were no <Return> <Return>thron away <Return> <Return> <Return>Every body
seemed happy; an <Return> <Return>te prais <Back>  <Back> of beingelightful ball,
which is seldom be <Return>tw <Tab> d till after a bal has ceased tobe,
ws repeatedly given int <Return> <Return> <Return>e very beginning ofh <Tab>  <Tab> existence of this.
Of <Return>ery important, very <Return>ecordable events, itas <Tab> not more productive
than such meetingusully are.  There wa <Back>  <Back> oe, howver, which Emma
thought so <Tab>  <Tab> ething of.--he two last dances <Back> efre supper w <Back>  <Back> re begun,
and Hrriet had no patner;--the only y <Tab> unlady <Back>  <Back> itting down;--
and <Tab> so equal had been htherto the number odncers, that how th <Tab> re
could be any one dis <Return> <Return>gaged was <Tab> the wonder--But Emma's <Back>  <Back>  <Back> wonder
lessened soon afterwds, on seeing Mr. <Back>  <Back> Elon sauntering <Back>  <Back> about.
He would not ask Harri <Tab> to dance if <Return> <Return> <Return>t were pssible to be avoided
she was <Back>  <Back> sure he would nt--ad she was expectig him every mo <Tab> ent to
Escape, howeve <Tab>  <Tab> , was nt his plan.  He <Return> <Return>ameo th <Return> <Return>part of the room
where the sitters-by we coll <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> cted, spoke toome, and walked <Back>  <Back>  <Back> bout

of main <Return> <Return>aining it.e did not omi <Tab> beinsometimes diretly

Emm <Return> <Return> <Return>saw it.  She wasnot yet dancing; sh <Tab>  <Tab> was working heray
up from the bo <Return> <Return> <Return>tom,nd had th <Return> <Return>refore lesure to lookaround,
and by onl <Return> <Return>turning hehead a little she <Return>sait all.  Wh <Back>  <Back>  <Back> n she was
half-way u <Back>  <Back> the set, thwholgroup were exacly behind her, and sh <Return>
would no <Return> <Return>onger allower eyesto watch; butMr. Elt <Back> n was so near,
that she heard ever <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> yllable of a dialouhich just then took
place between hm andrs. Weston; and she <Back>  <Back> rceived thathis wife,
 <Return> <Return>ho was standing immeditely above he <Back>  <Back>  <Back> , was noonly listening also
but even encou <Back>  <Back>  <Back> aging hm by sig <Return> <Return>ificant glanes.--The ki <Back> d-hearted,

"Me!--oh! no--I woul <Back>  <Back>  <Back> get you <Return> <Return> <Return>a better prtner t <Back> an myself.

Such an adventure as <Back>  <Back>  <Back> his,--a fie young mn and a lovely young <Return> <Return>

certain ideas <Tab>  <Tab> to thec <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ldest heart and te steadiest brain. <Back> 
SoEmma thought, at lest.  Could a ling <Back>  <Back>  <Back> istcould a gramarian,
could even a m <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> thematicin ha <Back> e seen what she di <Back>  <Back> have witnessed their

that circumstances haden at wok to make thempeculiarly interestng

be on <Tab> fire with specuation and for <Return>sight!-e <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> pecially with such
groundwork of antcipaion as her mid had <Back>  <Back>  <Back> already made.
It was <Return> <Return> <Return>a very extraorinary thing!  N <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> thinof the s <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> rt had ever
occurred be <Back>  <Back> ore to anyoung ladies in <Tab> the plae, within hermemory;
no rencontre <Return> <Return> <Return>no alam of th <Back>  <Back> kind;--andnow it had <Tab>  <Tab> appened
tthe very person,nd a <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> the very hourwhen th <Return> <Return> <Return>other very

was very <Return> <Return> <Return>extraordinar!--And knowing, ase did, the favourale
state <Tab> f mind of eachat this period, <Back>  <Back>  <Back> t srck her the more.
He was wishing to <Return>gett <Return>e better of his atachme <Tab>  <Tab> t to herself,
she j <Tab> st recovering frm her mania for <Back>  <Back> r. Eton.  It seemed a <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> if

t was not possible tat t <Return>e occurrence shuld not <Return> <Return>e strongly
In the few m <Back>  <Back> nutes' cnversation which s <Tab>  <Tab> ehad yet had with him
while Harrietad been prially insensible, head spoken of he <Tab> terror,
her naivete, he <Return> <Return> <Return>fervor asshe seized and cung to his arm, with <Tab> 
sensibility amuseanddelighted; and just <Return>alast, after Harrie's
own accont had beengven, he had expresed his indignation <Return>
at the abominable <Back> oly <Back>  <Back>  <Back> of Miss Bickertonn the warmes <Return> <Return>terms.
 <Tab>  <Tab> very thing was to takeits natural course, hoev <Back>  <Back> r, neither impelled
nor as <Return> <Return>isted.  She w <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ld not stir a stepnor drop a hint.
No, she had had eno <Return> <Return>gof <Back> nterference.  Tere could be no har <Return>
in a sche <Tab>  <Tab> e, a mere pasive scheme.  It was <Back> o mor <Back>  <Back> than a wish.
Emma's first reslutio <Return> <Return> <Return>as to keep her fathr from t <Back> e knowledge
of what <Tab>  <Tab> ad passed,--awae of the anxiety and al <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> rm it would occasion: <Return>
but she soon felt th <Back>  <Back> tconcealmen <Return> <Return> <Return>must be ipossible. <Back> ithin half
an ho <Return> <Return> <Return>r it was knownll over Highbury <Return>Iwas the very <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> event

Poor Mr. Woo <Tab>  <Tab> house trebl <Return>d as he sat, and,s Emma had foresee <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ,
would scarcely bsatsfied without their <Back>  <Back>  <Back> romising never t <Back>  <Back>  <Back> go
beyond the shrubbe <Back> y aain.  It was somecomort to him tat many

knew that heoved tobe inquired after), <Back> s well as Miss S <Return> <Return> <Return>ith,

of r <Return> <Return>turning for answr, tha <Return> <Return> <Return>they were alvery <Return> <Return> <Return>ndifferent--
which, though notxctly <Back>  <Back>  <Back> rue, for sheas perfect <Back>  <Back>  <Back> y well,
and Harriet not muchtherwise, Emma wo <Return>ldnot inter <Return>ere with.
She h <Back>  <Back>  <Back> d an unhappy stae of heal <Back>  <Back> h in genera <Return>or the child of such

invent illnesses fo <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> er, she <Back> could make nfigure in a mess <Tab> ge.
The gipsies did <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ot wat for the <Tab> operationsf justice; they <Tab> took
themsel <Return> <Return>es off in a hury.  The y <Return> <Return>ung ladiesof Highbury might ha <Return> <Return>e

A very f <Tab>  <Tab> w days had pased afterthis adventre, when Ha <Return>riet came

Mrs. Elt <Return> <Return> <Return>n was very muh di <Return> <Return> <Return>appointed.  It ws th <Return>delay of a great

must all <Back>  <Back> wait, and evey projecte <Return> <Return> <Return>party betill o <Return> <Return>ly talked of.
So she though <Tab>  <Tab> at firt;--but a little co <Return> <Return>ideration convnced

go there again <Return> <Return> <Return>with thm in the autum <Back>  <Back> .  Itas settled t <Tab>  <Tab> at they
shou <Back> d go to Box Hill. <Tab> hat there was to besuch a party had b <Return>en
long geneally known:it had <Tab> even given te <Back>  <Back> dea of another.
Emma <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> had never been toBox Hill; she wi <Tab>  <Tab> hedo see what everbody
found so well wo <Back>  <Back> theeing, anshe andr. We <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ton had agreed
to chuse som <Return>fine moning and d <Tab>  <Tab> ive thithr.  Two or <Back> hree more

This was so ver <Back>  <Back>  <Back> wellunderstood beteen tem, that <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> Emma could
not bu <Tab>  <Tab> feel some surrise, and a li <Return>tle dspleasure, <Tab> on hearing
from Mr. Weston tate had been proposi <Return> <Return>gto Mr. Elton, as her
bother and sister hadailed her, thatthe twparties shoul <Return>unite,
and <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> go together; andhat as Mr. Elton havery readily aceded
to it, so it <Back>  <Back>  <Back> was toe, if she ha <Tab> no obection.  Now, <Back>  <Back>  <Back> as her
objec <Back>  <Back> ion was nothing <Return> <Return> <Return>ut her very great dslike of MrsElton,
of which Mr <Return> <Return>Weston musalready be perfect <Return> <Return> <Return>yware, it was nt worth

t <Return> <Return>him, which woulde gi <Back> ing pain to hiw <Back>  <Back> fe; and she found
herself therefore o <Back> lged to <Tab> consent to anarran <Back>  <Back> ement which she
would have done a gre <Tab>  <Tab> deal to avoid; an <Back>  <Back> arangement which <Back> ould
probaby expose her evn to the degra <Return>ationf being said t <Back>  <Back> be of
Mrs. Elon's party!  Evry feeling was <Tab>  <Tab> ffende; and the forb <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> arance
of her outward submisin left a heavy arrerue of sec <Back> et severity
in <Return> <Return> <Return>her reflections on thunmanageble goodwillf <Tab> r. Weston's temper.
"I am gla <Back> you approve owhat I have done," sai <Return> <Return>he very comfortably. <Return> <Return> <Return>
"But <Tab>  <Tab> thought you wuld.  Such sc <Return>emess these are nothing <Tab>  <Tab>

Emma denied none of i <Return>loud, and agreed toone of it <Tab> in private.
Itas now the middlef J <Return>ne, and the weathr fine; a <Return>d Mrs. Elton

The wretchedness ofacheme to Box Hill was <Back> in Emma's thoughtsll

She would not be ashamof theppearance ofh <Tab>  <Tab> penitence, so justly

and <Back>  <Back>  <Back> refrained from anyllusion that might en <Back> nger its mainte <Tab>  <Tab> ance.
They spoke, there <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ore, oMrs. C <Back> urchill's deathwith mutual forbe <Back>  <Back> rance.
Short lettes from Frak were received at <Tab>  <Tab> Radalls, communicating

It wasa more pressingco <Return> <Return> <Return>cern to shew atteni <Tab> n to Jane Fairfax,

She resolved to pre <Tab>  <Tab> il on her to <Back>  <Back>  <Back> pendday <Back> at Hartfield.
A note was written <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> orge it.  The invi <Back>  <Back>  <Back> atin was refused, and by <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab>

had spoken prophetic <Tab>  <Tab> ly, when <Back> e once said,"Em <Back>  <Back> a, you have been
no friendo Harriet Smth."--She was <Back>  <Back> afraid se hd done her nothing

She might have preven <Back> edth <Back>  <Back>  <Back> indulgence and incrase of such sentim <Back> nts.
Her influence wouldhavbeen enouh.  And nowshe was very co <Return> <Return> <Return>scious

Common sense would h <Return> <Return> <Return>e dir <Return> <Return> <Return>cted her to tel Harriet, that <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> he

She w <Back>  <Back>  <Back> s extremely angrwith herself.  If sh <Back>  <Back>  <Back> could not havbeen

Afor Jane Fairfax,she might at least <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> elieve her feeli <Return>gs

Emma <Tab>  <Tab> ould now imaginewhy <Back> er own attentionhad been slighted. <Return>
This discovery laid <Return>mansm <Return>ller matters open.No doubt <Return>t had been

In spite ofher vexation,she could not help <Back>  <Back>  <Back> feelig it almost ridiculus,

The intelligence, whih had been <Back> so anxiouly announced to <Return> <Return> <Return>er,

But <Return>of that, unforunately, there <Tab> old be no chanc.
"Well, Miss <Return> <Return> <Return>Woodhouse!"cried Hariet, comingage <Tab>  <Tab> ly into the room--

"I am del <Back>  <Back> ghted to har you speako stoly on the subject,"

in th <Back>  <Back> momentary conqust of eagerness over <Back>  <Back>  <Back> udgment, aspired <Return> <Return>to be
told that she did not f <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> rbid his attempt to <Return> <Return>atach <Back>  <Back>  <Back> er.--The superior

The afection, whiche had been a <Tab>  <Tab> king tobe alloweto create,
if he could, waslreay his!--Within haf ahour, he had <Tab>  <Tab> assed
f <Back> om a thoroughly dis <Back> essed state of mindto something so <Back> like

It was his jea <Return> <Return> <Return>ousy oFrank Churchill tahad taken h <Back>  <Back>  <Back> m from

without the slihtestpe <Return>ception of any thng extraordinary <Return> <Return>n

all the artices of nes he had <Return>received froMr. Perry, and talke <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab>

A <Back>  <Back>  <Back> long as Mr. Knightleremained with <Return>them, Ema's fever conti <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ued;
but when hwas goneshe began <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> to be aittle tranquillised <Tab> 
andsubdued--and in teourse of the sleeless night <Back>  <Back>  <Back> which was
the tax <Tab> for such an evni <Return> <Return> <Return>g, she found one otwo such ve <Return>y serious
points to consi <Return>er,s made h <Back>  <Back>  <Back> r feel, tht even her happine <Return>s
must have some alloy. <Back>  <Back> Her fathe <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> --and Harrit. <Back> She could not be
alone withouteelingthe full weig <Back>  <Back> t of teir separte claims;
and how to guard the <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ofor <Tab> of both to the utost, was the quest <Return> <Return> <Return>on.
With resect to herather,t was a quet <Return>on soon answered.
She hardly knew yet w <Tab> t Mr. Knightley wo <Return> <Return> <Return>ldask; but <Return> <Return>a very short
parley w <Back> th her owneart produced <Tab> the mst solemn resoluti <Return> <Return>n
of <Return> <Return>never quitting herather.--She even wep <Return> <Return>over the idea <Back>  <Back> of it,
as a <Back>  <Back> sin of thought.  Wile helived, it muste only an engageme <Return> <Return>t;
but she f <Tab>  <Tab> attered heself, that if dives <Return> <Return>ed of the dager of
draw <Return>ng her away, it mght <Return>become an increasof comfort to <Back>  <Back> him.--
How to do her b <Back> st byHarriet, was of mredifficult decis <Return> <Return>on;--
how to spare he <Return> <Return>fom any <Tab> unnecessarpain; how tmake
her any <Tab> possible atoement; how to appe <Tab>  <Tab> least her enemy?-- <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> 
On these subjects,eperplexity and di <Return> <Return>tess <Tab>  <Tab> were very great--
and her <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> mind had toass agin and againthrough ever <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> bitter
rep <Back>  <Back> oach and sorrowfl regret that had eer su <Back> rounded it.--
She could only resol <Return> <Return> <Return>e at last, thashewould sti <Tab>  <Tab> l avoid a
meeting wither, andommunicate all th <Return>t ned be t <Back> ld by letter;
that <Back>  <Back> it would be inexpessibly <Back>  <Back>  <Back> desirable toav <Back>  <Back>  <Back> her removed just

S <Return>e did not think it iHarriet's natur <Return>toscape being benefit <Return>d
by novelty and variety <Return>by <Tab> the streets, the sh <Return> <Return> <Return>s, and the children.--
At a <Return>y rate, it would ba proof ofttentionnd kindness in herself
from whom ever <Tab> thing wadue; a separat <Tab>  <Tab> on forhe present; an ave <Return> <Return>ting
of the evi <Tab>  <Tab> day, wen theymust alle toget <Tab>  <Tab> er again.
She <Return> <Return>ose early, and wote her lett <Tab>  <Tab> r to Hariet; an emplo <Tab>  <Tab> ment
which left her soveryserious, so nearly s <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> , that Mr.Knightley,
i <Return> <Return>walking up to Hartfied t <Return>breakfast, did notarrivet all too soon;
and half an <Return>our stoleafter <Tab> ards to go ovethe same grou <Back> d again

In order t <Return> <Return>assist aonce <Return> <Return>lment so essental to me, I was led <Tab>

perfectly free <Return>rom anytendeny to being attahed to me, w <Tab> s as much

frienly, goodhumourd playf <Return> <Return>lness, whicexactly suitedme.
We seemed tunderstaneach other.  From orela <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ive situation,
those attentions we <Back> e hr due, and <Back>  <Back> were felt tbe s <Back>  <Back> .--Whether Miss
Woodhouse bean reallto uderstand me beore the expira <Return>ion of

I rememer that I waswithin a mo <Return> <Return> <Return>ent of cfessing the truth,
and I then fancie <Return> <Return> <Return>shwas <Return> <Return> <Return>ot without susicion; but I have no <Back>  <Back>

Whatever strange things <Back> I said or did dur <Return> <Return>ng tat fortnight, yo <Back>  <Back> have

Ifou remember any quernesses, se <Tab> them allo t <Return> <Return> <Return>e right account.--
Of the <Return> <Return> <Return>pianoforte so muh talked of, I fe <Back>  <Back> l itonly necesary to say,
 <Tab>  <Tab> hat its being orderedas abso <Back>  <Back>  <Back> utely unknowno <Back>  <Back> iss F--, who would
never have allowed m <Return> <Return> <Return>o send it, <Tab> had any chice been given her <Tab> --
The delicacy of <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> hermind throughou <Back>  <Back>  <Back> thwhole engaement,

You will <Back> oon, I earnstly hope, kno <Return> <Return> <Return>herhoroughly yurself.--
No description can desc <Tab>  <Tab> be her.  She must tell <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ou herself what s <Tab>  <Tab> e is--
yet <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ot by word, forever was th <Return> <Return>re a humn creature who would <Back>  <Back>  <Back> 
so designedly <Return>uppressher own merit.--Si <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ceI beganhis letter,
whichill be longerthan I foresaw, I <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> hve <Back>  <Back>  <Back> heard from her.--
She gives a <Back>  <Back> good accountof herown health; buts she never com <Tab> lains,
I dare not depnd.  Iw <Back>  <Back> nt to have your opni <Back> n of her looks.
I know you <Back> ill soon calon her; shes livingn dread of the visit <Tab>  <Tab> 
Pe <Back>  <Back> haps it is paid aleady.  Let me heafom you without dela <Return> <Return>;
I am <Tab> impatient for athousand particul <Back> r.  Remember how f <Back>  <Back> w
minutes Ias at Randals, and in <Tab>  <Tab> how bewildred, how md a state:
and I am not much bet <Back>  <Back> er ye <Return> <Return>; still insaneeither from happness
or misery.  When <Tab> I thinof the kindnesand fvour I have met wi <Return> <Return>h,
ofer excellence andatience, and my unc <Back>  <Back>  <Back> es genersity, I am mad
with joy:  but <Back>  <Back>  <Back> hen I rcollect all <Return> <Return>the uneasiesI occasioned her,
 <Tab> nd how little I deseve to be forgiven, <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> a <Back>  <Back> mad with anger.
If I could but seeeagain!--But <Return> <Return>mustot <Tab> propose it yet.
My uncle has been to <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> go <Return> <Return>d for me to encroch.--I must still ad <Tab> 
to this <Tab> ong letter.  Yu have not heard all <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> tat you ought to hear <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> 
Icould not give any conected detailyesterda; but the suddenness, <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> 
and, in one ligt, the useasonablenes <Tab>  <Tab> with whih the affair b <Return>rst out,
needs explan <Return> <Return> <Return>tion; fothough the event <Tab>  <Tab> ofthe 26tult., as you
will conclude, imeditely opeed to me thhappiest pro <Back>  <Back> pects,
I shou <Return>d not have preumed on such early <Return> <Return>masures, bu <Tab> from the
very particular ci <Back> cumtanceswhich left men <Tab>  <Tab> t an hour to lose.
I should myselfhave shrnk fromany thing so haty, and she wou <Back>  <Back> d have
felt every scrup <Back>  <Back> e of mne with multiplied str <Back> ngth and <Back> refinement.--
But I had no choie.  Te <Tab> asty engagement shehad entered in <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> o with
that woman-- <Back>  <Back> ere, my de <Return> <Return>madam, I was obligedto leave off abruply,
to recollect and com <Back> osemyself. <Return> <Return> <Return>-I have been waking oer the country,
and am now, I hpe, raiona <Back> enough to makehe rest of my letter <Back>  <Back> 
what iought to be.--t is, in fact, a most <Back> mortifyinretrospect
for me.  I beha <Tab> ed shamfull <Tab>  <Tab> .  And here I canadmit, that m <Back>  <Back>  <Back> manners
to Miss <Tab>  <Tab> W., in being upleasant to <Tab> iss F.,ere highly blamable.
She disapproved the <Back>  <Back> ,hich o <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ght to have ben enough.--My plea <Return>f
concealing the tru <Return> <Return> <Return>h shedid not think suff <Tab> cien.--She was disp <Back>  <Back> eased;
I thought unreasonabl <Back>  <Back> s <Return> <Return>:  I thought her, oa thousand occasions <Return>
unneces <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> arily scrupulos <Back>  <Back>  <Back> and cautious:  I thught <Tab> her even cold.
But she was <Tab> lways righ.  If I had followed <Return> <Return>hr jdgment, and subdued
my spirits to thelevl of what she deem <Tab> dproper, I should hav <Tab>  <Tab> 
escapd the greatest unappiess I have ever kown.--e quarrelled.--
Do you <Back>  <Back>  <Back> emember the moning <Back> pent at Donwell--There eery little
dissatisfaction that haoccurred before came <Return>oa <Return> <Return>risis.  I was late;
I met her walking hoby hrself, and waned to walk with hr,
but she would not s <Return> <Return>ffr it.  She <Return> <Return>bsolutelyrefused to all <Back>  <Back>  <Back> w me,
which I then thoug <Tab>  <Tab> t mo <Return> <Return> <Return>unreasonable.  Now,owever, I s <Back>  <Back> e nothing
in it but a very nat <Back> al and conistent deree o <Tab>  <Tab> discretion.
While I, to blind tewold to our engagemnt, <Back>  <Back>  <Back> was behaving one
hour witobjectionabe parti <Return> <Return>ularity to aother woman, washe
to be con <Return>enting thenext to a <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> roposalhich might have <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ade
every previous <Return>cautionuseless?--Had we be <Return> <Return> <Return>nmet walking t <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> gether
btween Donwell and Hihbury, the truthmusthave been suspected <Back> --
I was ma <Return> <Return>enough, howver,o resent.--I dubted her affecti <Back> n.
I d <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ubted it more thnext <Tab>  <Tab> ay on Box Hil; when, provoked <Return>by
such conduct <Back> on my sie, such sha <Back>  <Back> eful, ino <Back>  <Back> ent neglect of her,
a <Return>d such apparent deot <Return> <Return> <Return>on to Miss W., ait wou <Tab> d have been
impossi <Back>  <Back> le for anyoman of sen <Return>e to edure, she spoke <Tab>  <Tab> her
resentment in <Back>  <Back>  <Back> a formof wrds perfectlyntelligible to me <Tab> --
In short, <Return> <Return>y dear madm, it was a quar <Return> <Return>ellameless on hr side,
abominable on <Tab>  <Tab> ine; ad I retuned the samev <Tab>  <Tab> ning to Richmond,
though I might havstai <Return>with you til <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> the next morning,
merely because I <Back>  <Back>  <Back> woulde as angry with hr aspossible.  Even t <Return> <Return> <Return>en,
I was not such a foo <Return> <Return> <Return> <Back>  <Back>  <Back> s not to mean to bereconci <Return> <Return>ed in time;
but I was the inju <Return>edersoninjured by hercoldness,nd I went
away dete <Back> mined that se shou <Back> d make the firt advanc <Return> <Return> <Return>s.--I shall
always congratulte myslf that <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ou were not othe Box Hill party <Tab> 
Had you witn <Return> <Return> <Return>ssed my beaviour there, I <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> an hadly suppose you would <Return> <Return> <Return>
ever have <Tab>  <Tab> thought welof me again. <Back> Its efect upon her appear
in the immediate <Tab>  <Tab> resou <Return> <Return> <Return>ion it produced:s <Back>  <Back>  <Back> soon as she found I
wa <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> really gone fromandalls, shelosedith thoffer of that
officious Mrs. <Back>  <Back>  <Back> lton;he whole system of <Back>  <Back>  <Back> whse treatment oher,
by the by <Tab>  <Tab> , has everfilledme with indinat <Tab>  <Tab> on and hatred.
I must not quarrl wih <Tab>  <Tab> spirit of forbeaan <Tab>  <Tab> e which has been
so richly extended to <Back>  <Back> rds <Back>  <Back>  <Back> yself; but, othewi <Tab> e, I should loudly
protest agains <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> thehare of it whic <Tab> tht woman has knwn.--
"J <Tab>  <Tab> ne," indeed!--You wil observe that I have <Back> ot yet indulged m <Tab>  <Tab> self
in calling her <Return>by thatname,even to you.  Tink, then <Return> <Return> <Return>what I must
have endured in hearig it bandied beweenthe Eltons with all <Return> <Return>
the vulgarty of needes <Tab> repetition, andll the insolence of <Return>
imaginary superi <Return> <Return> <Return>rity.ave patience with me, I <Return> <Return> <Return>shall soon have done.- <Back>  <Back>  <Back> 
She closed wi <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> h thisffer, resolving t <Return> <Return>b <Return> <Return> <Return>ak with me entirely,
and wrote the next <Tab>  <Tab> dayo tell me that we ne <Tab>  <Tab> e <Return>ere to meet again.--
She felt the e <Return> <Return> <Return>gagemet to be a <Return> <Return>source ofepentance and misry
 <Back>  <Back>  <Back> o each:  she dissolvd it.--Th <Return> <Return>s letter rached <Return> <Return> <Return>e on the very
morning of m <Tab> poor aut's death. <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> I answerd it <Back>  <Back> ithin an hour;
but fromhe confusionof <Return> <Return> <Return>y mind, and the mltiplicityof business
falling o <Return> <Return> <Return>me at oncemy answ <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> r, insteadf bein <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> sent with all

to stisfy her, remaied without any unea <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ne <Return> <Return> <Return>s.--I was rather
disappointed tht Idid not hear frmer ag <Return> <Return> <Return>in speedily;
but <Back>  <Back>  <Back> made excuses foher, and was <Back>  <Back> too buy, and--may I <Tab>  <Tab> dd?--

"While he <Back>  <Back>  <Back> dear father lved, any change <Back>  <Back>  <Back> of condt <Back>  <Back> on must be impossible

but such an altrna <Back>  <Back> ve as this had no <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ccurred to her.
Sh <Back>  <Back>  <Back> was sensible of althe affe <Return> <Return>tion it eviced. <Return> <Return> <Return>he felt that,

The delightful fmilyparty which Emma wssecuring for her <Return> <Return> <Return>elf,
poor Harriet mus, imere charitab <Tab>  <Tab> e cation,be kept at a

deplore <Return>her future absece as an <Tab> deduction frm her own enjo <Back> ment.
In such a party, <Return>Harrie <Back> ould be rather a deaweight than oth <Back>  <Back> rwise;
but for the poor girl h <Tab>  <Tab> rself, it seemed a peliarly cruel necessi <Back>  <Back> y
that was to be <Return> <Return>placingher in such a state ounm <Back> rited punishment.
In <Return> <Return>time, of course, M. <Back>  <Back> Knightley would befor <Tab>  <Tab> otten, that is,

so truly considerat <Tab>  <Tab> or every body, <Return> <Return>ouldnever deserve tobe
less worshiped than nw; andit really wasoo much to hop <Return> <Return> <Return>even
of Harriet, that <Return>sheould be in l <Return> <Return> <Return>ve withm <Return>re than three men
It wasa very great rlief t <Back> Emma to findHarriet <Tab>  <Tab> as desirous
s herself to avoid <Return> <Return> <Return>meeting.  Their iner <Back>  <Back> ourse was painful
enou <Return>h by letter.  Howmuch worse, had they <Back> een obliged to me <Return> <Return> <Return>t!
Harret expressed hrself very much <Return> <Return>sm <Tab> ght be supposed,
without reproaches, <Return> <Return>or aparent sense of ill-uae; and <Back> yet Emma fancied
there was a <Return> <Return>somethingf resentment, a s <Back>  <Back>  <Back> meting bordering <Back>  <Back> n it in
her syle, which increasd the desirableness o <Back>  <Back> heir <Return> <Return> <Return>being separate.--
It mig <Tab> t be only herwn consciousness; buit seemed as if an
angel onlyould have be <Tab>  <Tab> quite without resentmnt under such a stroe.
She h <Return> <Return>d no difficuly in procuring Isa <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ella'sinvitation;
and she wa <Back>  <Back> fortunaten having <Tab>  <Tab> sufficientreason for <Tab> sking it,
without resorting <Return> <Return>ivention.--Therewas a tooth <Return> <Return> <Return>amiss.
Harriet really wishe <Tab>  <Tab> , ad had wished some time, <Return> <Return>to consult a den <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ist.
Mr <Back>  <Back>  <Back> . John Knightley w <Back> delighted to be ofuse; any th <Return>ng of ill
health was <Back> a recommenatin to her--and thu <Return>h not so fond of a
dentists of a Mr. Wigfield, she was qui <Return> <Return> <Return>eeager to have Har <Back>  <Back> iet
under her <Back> are.--Whenit was thus se <Tab> tledn her sister'side,
Emma propsed it to hefrien, and found hevery persuadabl <Tab>  <Tab> .--
Harrietas to go; sheas invted for at leasa fortnight; she was <Back>  <Back> 
toe conveyed in Mr.oodhouse's <Back> arriage.-It was all arra <Return> <Return> <Return>ged,
it was all c <Return> <Return>mpleted,and Harriet w <Tab>  <Tab> s safein Brunswick <Back> quare.
Now Emma cou <Back> d, inded, enjoy Mr. <Return>Knighte <Return> <Return>'s visits; now she
could talk, and <Return>she cold <Back>  <Back>  <Back> listen with true hpp <Tab>  <Tab> ness, unchecked by
that sense of in <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ustce, of guilt, <Return>of soething most <Tab>  <Tab> painful,

The differe <Return>ce of Harrieat Mrs. Goddard's, on Lon <Back>  <Back> on, made perhaps
an unreasonabl <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> differnce in Emm <Tab> 's sensatins; but she could not

which mu <Back>  <Back> t be avertingthe past, and carryin <Back>  <Back> her out of hers <Tab>  <Tab> lf.
She woul <Tab>  <Tab> not allow anyother <Tab> nxiety to succed directly to the pla <Return>e

the confessin of he <Back>  <Back>  <Back> engagement to herater; but she would
have nothng to do witit at present.--S <Tab> ead resolved to defer <Back>

t <Return>crown every warmer,bu <Return> <Return>more agitating, dlight, should b <Back> hers.
She soo <Back>  <Back> resolved, eqully as a du <Back>  <Back>  <Back> y and a peasure, to empl <Return>y half

Harriet was mo <Tab>  <Tab> t happyto give evry particuar of <Return>he evening at

* The Assembly <Return> <Return> <Return>ine <Back>  <Back>  <Back> ecuting the plan oftheir c <Return> <Return>mmittee, made
so <Tab>  <Tab> e alterations. Tey have <Back>  <Back> struck outo <Return>e stage in these
g <Back>  <Back> adations; this remoes a part of <Back>  <Back> he objcton; but the main
objetion, namely, thain their s <Back>  <Back>  <Back> heme theirst constituent <Return> <Return>voter
has no connect <Return> <Return> <Return>on withhe representat <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ve legilator, remains in all

demerit of <Return>hese smaler alteratio <Tab> s appeas to be of n <Back>  <Back>  <Back> moment
where the schee itslf is <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> undamentallyvicious and absur <Back> .
In all this pr <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ces, which in i <Tab>  <Tab> s fundamntal elements affects
to consider only <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> populaion upon a principle onat <Back> ral right, there
is a <Return>manifest attenton to property <Return> <Return>whih, howeve <Back>  <Back> just and

When they c <Return>me to teir third basis, <Return>thatf contribution, <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> e find
 <Tab> hat they have more comlet <Return>ly lost sight of teir rights of mn. This
last basi <Return> <Return>rests entirey on <Return> <Return> <Return>roperty. A princple totally differ <Tab> nt
from the equa <Back>  <Back> ity of me, and utter <Tab> y irreconcl <Back>  <Back> ble to it, is thereby
admitt <Return> <Return>d; but no sooneis this principl <Tab>  <Tab> aditted than (as u <Return>ual)
it is subverted; andtis not subvert <Back> d (as wshall prese <Tab> tly see)

addi <Tab>  <Tab> ional share in ththird portion o <Return>repesentation <Return> <Return> <Return>(a portion
reserved exclusivel <Back> fr the higher cntribuion) is m <Tab>  <Tab> de to regard
the district <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> only, andot the indivi <Tab> uals int who pay. It is easy <Return> <Return>
to prceive, by the corse otheir reasonins, how much <Back>  <Back>  <Back> they were
embarrassed by their <Return>cn <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> radictory ideas ofhe <Return> <Return>rights of men and
the privileges of ric <Back>  <Back> s. The committee o <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> cnstitution do as god

pernicious, too, <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> becus <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> it leads to thees <Tab>  <Tab> ablishment of an
aristocracy of <Back>  <Back>  <Back> the ric. However, it mus <Tab> nobebandoned. And the
way of <Back>  <Back> getting rid of te <Return> <Return> <Return>ifficulty is to estbli <Back> h the inequality as
betw <Back>  <Back>  <Back> en department andepartmen <Back>  <Back> , leaving allthe indiv <Back>  <Back> duals in each
department upon an <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> xct par. Oserve thatthis p <Back>  <Back> rity between

Now take it in teouter point of vi <Tab> w ad let us <Tab>  <Tab> uppose their

what ad <Return> <Return> <Return>antage they derve <Back>  <Back>  <Back> from the aristocratc preferenc <Return>upon which

With you <Back> here is litte, or <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> ather no, connction between th <Back>  <Back>  <Back> last

abou <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> five in the afernoon, I s <Back>  <Back>  <Back> epped oer to a <Return> <Return> <Return>ruiterer's

and the young wmenI met wi <Tab> h the folowing adveture.
Whilst I was <Back> cafferinfor the fuitwanted, I ob-
servd myself follo'd by a young gnteman, whose rich
dress first atractdmy notice; for te re <Back>  <Back> t, he had no-
thing r <Back>  <Back>  <Back> markable in <Tab>  <Tab> is person, exceptthat he was pale, <Return>
 <Back> hin-made, and ventr'd himslf upon lg <Return> <Return> <Return>rather of the

certinly I was nott all out o <Return>figureto pass for a <Tab>  <Tab> odest

him no opening to <Back>  <Back> ojec <Tab> ure my conditio.  He spoke to me
and this addressfrm a stranger throng a blush into <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> y
cheeks that stil <Return> <Return>st himwider off th <Return>ruth, I answered
him with an aukw <Tab>  <Tab> rdn <Back>  <Back>  <Back> s and confusion thmore apt to impose <Tab>  <Tab> 
as there was rea <Back> lya mixture <Tab> f the gnuine in <Tab>  <Tab>  <Tab> them.  But
